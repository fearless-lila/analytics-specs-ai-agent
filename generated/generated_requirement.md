Here is a detailed analytics requirement generated based on the user request:

**Event Name:** `checkoutProcessInteraction`

**Business Description:**
The purpose of this event is to track the various stages of the user's interaction with the new checkout page, allowing us to analyze their behavior and identify areas for improvement.

**Behavioral Description:**

1. **Initialization**: The event is triggered when the user enters the checkout process.
2. **Address Entry**: When the user enters their shipping address, the event `checkoutProcessInteraction` fires with a new basicOp value indicating the component (`address`) and feature (`entry`).
3. **Payment Method Selection**: After selecting a payment method, the event fires again with an updated basicOp value indicating the component (`payment`) and feature (`selection`).
4. **Card Information Entry**: When the user enters their card information, the event fires once more with an updated basicOp value indicating the component (`card`) and feature (`entry`).
5. **Review and Confirmation**: Before completing the payment process, the event fires to track the user's review of their order summary.
6. **Payment Completion**: Upon successful completion of the payment process, the event fires one last time with an updated basicOp value indicating the component (`payment`) and feature (`completion`).
7. **Checkout Process Abandonment**: If the user abandons the checkout process, the event fires to track the abandonment reason.

**Fields:**

* `basicOp`
	+ `component`: The component being interacted with (e.g., `address`, `payment`, `card`)
	+ `feature`: The specific feature or action being performed (e.g., `entry`, `selection`, `completion`)
	+ `isDeferred`: A boolean indicating whether the interaction is deferred (i.e., not required for user flow)

**CONNECTORS**
### Adobe:

#### Type: ACTION

| Adobe field | Bertie field |
| --- | --- |
| s.contextData['content_interaction'] = | 1 |
| s.contextData['page_interaction_element_name'] = | <`basicOp.component`>`:`<`basicOp.feature`> |
| s.contextData['page_interaction_element_type'] = | `<basicOp.component>` |

**BDD:**

### `checkoutProcessInteraction`

GIVEN I am on the checkout page

WHEN I select a payment method

THEN fire `checkoutProcessInteraction` event with basicOp having component `payment` and feature `selection`

...

GIVEN I abandon the checkout process without completing payment

WHEN I click on the "Abandon" button

THEN fire `checkoutProcessInteraction` event with basicOp having component `abandoned` and feature `completion`

**Notes:**

* The event tracking for this analytics requirement will be triggered by Bertie's event listener, which will send an Adobe Action to track user interactions.
* The events will be fired on the checkout page, allowing us to analyze user behavior throughout the payment process.
* The deferred flag will be used to indicate whether an interaction is not required for user flow.
