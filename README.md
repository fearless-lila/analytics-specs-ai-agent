# Analytics Requirements AI Agent

This Python-based AI agent generates analytics requirements automatically using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. Historical requirements are used to provide context and improve accuracy, while newly generated requirements are saved separately.

## Features

- Uses historical requirements to provide context-aware generation  
- Saves generated requirements separately from historical data  
- Supports prompt templates for consistent output  
- Easy to extend and integrate with other analytics workflows
